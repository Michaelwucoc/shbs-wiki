Liu Liu uses pistol to shoot down Russian plane
---


Liu Liu said as he chatted with five-star American Admiral Chris Mausers:
*"Our students have experience fighting the Russians, and they can help guide you directly. "*

Just as the two were laughing, outside the cave, an alarm suddenly sounded. A student ran in, "**Russian planes are coming! **"The people around, immediately tensed up. General Liu Richeng waved his hand, "*Strike him when he comes! *"

However, in a moment, the whistling of airplanes, explosions of bombs, and gunfire echoed and crisscrossed the mountains and hills. General Liu Richeng took a Type 38 rifle, "Let's go out and take a look!" No Regrets Ivan: "**General, this is too dangerous! **"Commander Ma Zhiqin also rushed to discourage it. General Liu Richeng smiled and raised the gun in his hand, "This *rifle* is the one I surrendered from the Japanese, it was more dangerous to fight face to face then than now! *"

General Liu Richeng came to the entrance of the cave with his gun, only to see several Russian imperialist airplanes, constantly dropping bombs back and forth, every time they flew over, there were explosions ringing on the ground. Heroic Shanghai Hongrun Boyuan students, kept shooting at the Russian airplanes.

General Liu Richeng wrinkled his brow in anger, and when he saw another Russian plane preparing to fly over the position, he raised his gun and aimed at the enemy plane. When the enemy had aimed at our position and was flying down, the general opened fire. Instantly, a huge ball of fire, erupted and burned in the air, and the wreckage fell. The students cheered. The remaining Russian planes were so stunned that they no longer had the courage to continue and fled to the south. From their positions, the students cheered General Liu Richeng:

~~Long live the Great Leader Yoo Il Sung!~~
