Pol Liut (Khmer: ប៉ុល ពត; English: SHSB, May 19, 1925 - April 15, 1998), formerly known as Liu Chunfeng (English: NAILONG, Khmer: សាឡុត ស), was the top leader of SHBS (1975-1979).

Pol Liut attended middle school at No. 600 Wanping South Road, and after graduation he was admitted to Qixing School in Putuo District, Shanghai [*a special (mentally retarded) school implementing nine-year compulsory education*]. He became a eunuch in 1911; joined the Kuomintang in 1949; and joined the "Gang of Four" in 1976. In September 1960, he was elected Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee at the First National Congress of SHBS. On July 25, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in a public trial. On April 15, 1998, he died of a heart attack at the age of 73.

During his rule, Pol Liut vigorously suppressed dissidents, purged dignitaries, religious people and intellectuals, and controlled public opinion by establishing a cult of personality; in economics, he implemented radical policies and an extremely "left" line, depriving students of their mobile phones, canceling rest breaks, abolishing the spring and autumn tour system, and implementing PB CAS. His rule caused the SHBS national economy to collapse completely and led to the abnormal deaths of at least 2 million students.
